12 Day Process:

Day 1 and 2: Rocket ship
Item #1 in Tec Spec:
- controls:
    - keyboard:
        Up Arrow arrow:
            - thruster that moves ship in the direction
        Left and Right Arrow: Rotates the ship, ship direction cannot be downward angled
    - gravity
    - starting position is in the upper right hand corner of the game
Day 3: platform
Make a basic platform that is land-able
    - make rocket ship be able to land on the bottom of the game (the easiest platform)
    -  if rocket lands with any horizontal velocity or the vertical velocity isn't very low
       or lands at an angle that isn't close to perpendicular to the platform, rocket ship does not land successfully
Day 4: Harder platforms
Implement progressively smaller platforms
    - Platform get assigned random dimensions that are connected to the bottom of the game
    - keep the platforms dimensions smaller that half of the width and half of the height
Day 5: Level progression
    - After each successful or unsuccessful landing, the rocket ship is reset to the starting position
    - the platform is remade as a randomly generated platform
        - the platforms should generally get smaller/skinnier after each landing attempting
Day 6: Fuel
Refer to Object #3 in Tec Spec
    - If the fuel level is zero, the up arrow doesn't work (i.e. thruster stops working)
Day 7: score
   - Upper left hand corner is the score in a rectangular box, which is how many platforms have successfully been landed on
   - each time there is a successful landing, the score increases by 1
Day 7: Game reset
- if the fuel gets to 0, and then the ship breaks / misses platform, then game is over
     - the fuel gets reset, the score gets reset to 0 in the next game
Day 8: Multiplayer
-  a second rocket ship randomly generated
 - a second score for player2 is to the right of player1's score box
 (How will one players game platform be updated but the other one's stays?)
 Day 10: Home screen
  - Start of game shows Title and quick selection between single player and multiplayer modes
  - make a high score for the single player mode that shows on the screen
  Day 11 and 12: Put in pause button that pauses game and a quit button that goes to home screen
  Day 13: Multiplayer collisions:
   - if players collide, whoever is going fast survives that round and can try to land, the other one destroyed
  Day 14: super gravity mode
    - gravity is twice as strong
  Day 15: When player's rocket breaks in all modes: the png of the ship gets updated to a broken ship for a sec before dissEl Reino del Cieloapearing
