Thereâ€™s a platform for a rocket ship to land on at the bottom of the screen.

You start with a finite amount of fuel in the rocket and
the goal of the game is to try and land the rocket on the platform while conserving the most amount of fuel possible.

After landing you are reset above the platform with a random direction that you have to correct and land.



To move the rocket, you use the arrow keys. Up arrow turns on the thruster and
the left and right arrows rotate the ship. When the up arrow is pressed, the spaceship png changes to the
spaceship thrust png.

The thruster reduces or increases the rocket speed in the direction the ship is pointing.

For example, if the rocket is pointed directly horizontal, there will be no change in vertical velocity,
only a large change in horizontal velocity.
q
If the rocket is pointed 45 degrees above horizontal the changes in vertical and horizontal velocity
will be equal




For UI, there is a fuel bar that decreases as you use your thruster
There is also a text box that says: Number of consecutive landings
There is also a text box that says: High score
            this is the largest number of consecutive landings achieved this far
For multiplayer mode there is also the score of player one and player two


The game consists of multiple consecutive "landings"
A landing is one instance of the rocket randomly starting above the platform and the player attempting to
land on the platform.


For multiplayer, there are two rockets, both with separate, randomly determined velocity speeds and velocity directions

The first person to land their rocket on the platform will win a point. The aim of the game is to get to the platform first,
but you also have to conserve fuel because once you run out, if the other player still has fuel left, they get to try and
land their ship without competition until they run out of fuel.

One player uses WASD, the other uses arrow keys



In order to safely land the rocket, you need to have no horizontal velocity and a very small vertical velocity.
If there is any horizontal velocity or too high of vertical velocity, the rocket explodes and your fuel is cut in half


The platform height and width will be randomly determined at the start of each landing.
