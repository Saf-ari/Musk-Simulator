Tech Specs:
Start of game shows Title and quick selection between single player and multiplayer modes
Objects:

1. Rocket ship:
  - integer of fuel: starting fuel is 1000
  - controls:
      - keyboard:
          Up Arrow and down arrow:
              - if fuel isn't zero, the the arrow keys work
              - thruster that moves ship in the direction
              - every second key is pressed, fuel constantly falls by 1, for a total of -10fuel/second
2. platform
   - randomly generates as a rectangle with a random size at a point coming from the bottom of the canvas
   - if rocket lands with any horizontal velocity or over a small vertical velocity or at an angle that isn't perpendicular to the platform, rocket ship breaks.
3. Fuel gage
   - in the upper right hand corner, that shows the fuel amount as previously stated
   - a small rectangle
   - fuel resets only when the game resets but stays as long as there continue to be successful landings
4. score
   - Upper left hand corner is the score in a rectangular box, which is how many platforms have successfully been landed on
   - each time there is a successful landing, the score increases by 1

Game reset:
   - if the fuel gets to 0, and then the ship breaks / misses platform, then game is over
        - the fuel gets reset, the score gets reset to 0 in the next game
Multiplayer:
 - a second rocket ship randomly generated
 - a second score for player2 is to the right of player1's score box
 What does random velocity have to do with game?
 - winner is determined by who lands more time, (How will one players game platform be updated but the other one's stays?)
